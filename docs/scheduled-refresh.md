# Scheduled Refresh

Hometown can update the prompt on a schedule.

By default, this feature is _disabled_. Set `HOMETOWN_REFRESH_INTERVAL` to a positive integer to refresh dynamic data every `HOMETOWN_REFRESH_INTERVAL` seconds.

:::warning
It's possible that your battery will drain more quickly if scheduled refresh is enabled. How many terminals you have open at a time may be a factor. Effect may vary by computer model.
